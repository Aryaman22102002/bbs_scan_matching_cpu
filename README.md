### About the Project
As part of my EECE5550 Mobile Robotics course's project at Northeastern University, I reproduced a simplified version of the CPU-only implementation of the 3D-BBS (Branch-and-Bound Scan Matching) algorithm for global localization using LiDAR data. This project aligns 3D LiDAR scans to a voxelized map by exhaustively searching a 4D pose space (x, y, z, yaw) and scoring candidates using voxel occupancy overlap.

This algorithm was originally proposed in the 3D-BBS: Global Localization for 3D Point Cloud Scan Matching Using Branch-and-Bound paper.
Link to the paper - https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10610810

This implementation focuses on:

- Efficient voxel hashing and occupancy-based scoring.

- Hierarchical BnB search with pruning.

- Tested on real-world LiDAR data from the KITTI Odometry dataset.

Includes tools for:

- Fake initialization experiments.

- Perturbation robustness testing.

- Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) & Angular Orientation Error (AOE) evaluation.

### Results

The system was tested on real LiDAR data from the KITTI Sequence 00. The implementation successfully aligned incoming scans to a pre-built voxel map using a branch-and-bound search over a 4D pose space. Qualitative results showed progressive convergence during scan-to-map alignment, with clear visual overlap even under moderate perturbations or poor initial guesses.

- Progressive scan alignment.
- Robust to small spatial perturbations.
- Sensitive to large yaw errors.
- CPU-only full search was slow, highlighting the need for optimization.

For explanation of the algroithm, quantitative results (ATE, AOE), experimental comparisons, limitations, and future work discussion, please refer to the full project report. <br>

Below is a video that demonstrates global scan-to-map alignment using a CPU-only implementation of the 3D-BBS (Branch-and-Bound Scan Matching) algorithm. <br>

The incoming LiDAR scan (Frame 6) is aligned against a voxelized map built from Frames 0 to 4 of the KITTI Odometry Sequence 00. The visualization shows how the scan gradually aligns to the map as the branch-and-bound traversal progresses, illustrating the effectiveness of the method without relying on GPU acceleration. <br>

Red points represent the transformed scan under different pose guesses. As the Branch-and-Bound search progresses, the scan shifts from misaligned outskirts to a tightly overlapping position, maximizing alignment with the blue voxel map.
